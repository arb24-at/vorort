# VorOrt collaboration handoff

Last updated: 2026-08-14

## Current handoff

- Active branch: `main`.
- Current working state: the Astro application has been relocated to `ω┇Engine`; documentation and validation are implemented locally but are not yet committed or pushed.
- Local validation: `npm run validate` passes with 23 HTML pages, 22 sitemap URLs, zero missing `/vorort/` targets, and zero stale `/astro-demo/` paths.
- Local server verification: German home, English home, representative private and business pages, a badge asset, and the sitemap all return HTTP 200 from `/vorort/`.
- Deployment state: the previously pushed bilingual site is live. This directory reorganization will deploy only after the current changes are committed and pushed to `main`.
- Known blockers: public brand, telephone, WhatsApp, email, postal/legal identity, certificate evidence, form backend, analytics, and production domain remain unresolved or provisional.
- Recommended next action: review the current diff, commit and push it to `main`, wait for GitHub Pages, then verify the live home, English home, sitemap, canonical URL, and stylesheet path.

## Work log

## 2026-08-14 — Codex — Discovery, bilingual foundation, and engine organization

- Objective: understand the inherited IT-support prototype, establish a truthful Berlin demand-test foundation, repair GitHub Pages, add useful German/English service coverage, and leave a maintainable context system for future models.
- Changes:
  - Audited routes, components, styles, assets, content, SEO, deployment, build health, and the external Obsidian Chain.
  - Added a German-root/English-`/en/` architecture with separately authored copy and alternate-language metadata.
  - Added three dedicated private service pages and three business service pages in both languages.
  - Added optional English-service messaging, WhatsApp contact, an email-preparation form, Open Graph basics, and a generated sitemap.
  - Repaired the `/vorort/` GitHub Pages base and removed the duplicate deployment workflow; the bilingual commit was pushed as `eb7317c` and verified live.
  - Relocated the application into `ω┇Engine`, created the root agent contract and three-document system, added static-output validation, and updated the Pages workflow for the subdirectory.
  - Extracted useful visual principles from the standalone HTML concept and removed the redundant prototype.
- Decisions:
  - VorOrt remains internal; the public brand is undecided.
  - German stays at `/`, English at `/en/`, with stable translation IDs and independent editorial copy.
  - The external Chain remains high-level; `Roadmap.md` owns repository implementation phases.
  - Project context, website map, roadmap, and collaboration reporting are limited to three documentation files plus root `AGENTS.md`.
  - All Astro and npm work runs from `ω┇Engine`; the root has no wrapper package.
- Validation:
  - Fresh `npm ci` completed inside `ω┇Engine`.
  - `npm run validate` built 23 HTML pages and verified 22 sitemap URLs, all internal `/vorort/` targets, and no stale demo paths.
  - Development-server checks returned HTTP 200 for both language homes, representative private/business pages, a public asset, and the sitemap.
- Blockers or required input: real business identity/contact/legal data, chosen brand/domain, verified credentials, conversion backend, measurement stack, and a reviewed service/promise boundary.
- Recommended next action: publish and verify the engine reorganization, then begin Roadmap phase 2 with real business data and dependency/security maintenance.
